## Venn Diagram
 is a diagram that shows all possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves, usually circles, each representing a set.

## Goal
For our Bioinformatics project, we decided to use data visualization methods which are very popular in these days. As a first thing to do, we decided to use the most basic and understandable diagram.

We created basic and responsive Venn Diagram by using JavaScript. It changes according to the values of sets and intersection values of sets.
